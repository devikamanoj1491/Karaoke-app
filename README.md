# 🎤 AI Karaoke Maker

An AI-powered web application that separates music tracks into stems (drums, bass, vocals, and others) and automatically "glues" the instrumental parts back together for a perfect karaoke experience.

## 🚀 Features
* **AI Stem Separation:** Uses Meta's Demucs (`mdx_extra_q` model) for high-quality audio splitting.
* **Auto-Mixing:** Integrated FFmpeg logic to combine drums, bass, and "other" tracks into a high-quality 320k MP3 instrumental.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Backend handles heavy AI tasks in the background so the UI stays responsive.
* **Polling System:** Real-time status updates from the frontend until your file is ready for download.
* **Forced Downloads:** Custom API headers to ensure files download directly to your computer instead of opening in a browser player.
